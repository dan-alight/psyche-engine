{% include "common.j2" %}

<instructions>
Come up with one activity I could complete today to make progress on my goal.
Make sure it is concise, simple, clear, and actionable. It should be something specific that I can accomplish *today*, not a general or long-term task.
Do not assume anything about my current progress towards the goal. Your suggestion should be relevant regardless of how much progress I've already made.
Do not include any additional information, context, or explanation—just provide the single activity.
